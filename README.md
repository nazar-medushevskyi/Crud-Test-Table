# Crud-Test-Table

**CRUD** stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete â€” fundamental operations for managing data in a database or other data storage system. These actions encompass adding new data (Create), retrieving existing data (Read), modifying data (Update), and removing data (Delete). CRUD operations provide a standardized way to interact with and manipulate data, commonly used in web applications, APIs, and various software systems.
